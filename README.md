# nilnul.mathMl._pub

This ia an ASP.NET WebControl Library. 
To view a demo, open the .sln file in the "_Demo" folder and run, the a page with MathML will show up. You need a browser such as Firefox to support MathML.

To use the controls in your asp.net project, 
1) just add this library project into your solution.
2) compile this library and the controls will show up in a pane named "nilnul.mathMl._ctr" in your toolbox.
3) The toolbox pane may not show up till you open a .ascx or .aspx file and click into its markup or design interface.
3) Then in a web project in your solution, open an .ascx or .aspx file. Drag the controls into your page. For mathML, you need a "math" element; so you may want to drag in the "math" control, then drag other controls in it. 

For MathML standard, view it at w3.org. To display the mathML, you have to have a browser that supports mathML; FireFox can do it; and IE can do it if your webpage contains MathJax.
For the naming convention of the controls, classes, namespaces in this library, view the style book: http://nilnul.com/_apps/wyt.dev/style/_/Aspx.aspx .
